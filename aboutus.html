                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2010, Library study space quickly established itself as an icon par excellence
                    in Hong Kong.  study space will return to a walk up service across the campus with the exception of 
                    a small number of bookable study spaces on the 3rd and 5th floors of the Main Library in George Square. 
                    This means that you will no longer need to book study space unless you wish to.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the re-opening of all study spaces we have put some measures in place to keep our students 
                    safe. All desks will be assigned with a unique QR code and you must check in and check-out of the desk by 
                    scanning the QR code. This is for the purpose of NHS Test & Protect - Scotland’s way of putting into 
                    practice the test, trace, isolate, support strategy - and is not a study space booking.</p>
